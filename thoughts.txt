    error that you need to fix
    
    // also the grid, depending on the number
    // doesn't do balanced (i.e. 100x100, 50x 50)
    // it's like 16 across and like a lot more down]



based off the number given, you want that number to
be the number of squares per side. 
The problem is that it doesn't do that.
The amount of squares should fill up the total space
depending on the number.
Like there should be balanced space between each box.
The way I think I could do this is through the flex
property.
I think each item should fill up the same amount of space
depending on the number.

number = 16
there should only be 16 boxes at the top

/ note 
flex-wrap: wrap; contradicts align-items: stretch for some reason


something is probably wrong with height and width of the items


create a new row within the container,
    create the amount of divs
    based on the number given within that row,
after that create a new row until you hit number
