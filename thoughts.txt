if (changeSquare >= 0 
    && changeSquare <= 100) {

        you want to use generateContent
        function and multiply given number
        by itself to equal numberOfItems
        
        then you want to run through the
        function and print out the new 
        border and delete the old border

    } else {
        return;
    }



    error that you need to fix
    // on click prompt, change number, - works
    // however I haven't been able to figure out
    // how to delete the previous grid from
    // generateContent and print out a new one

    // also the grid, depending on the number
    // doesn't do balanced (i.e. 100x100, 50x 50)
    // it's like 16 across and like a lot more down
